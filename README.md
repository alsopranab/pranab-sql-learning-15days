#  SQL Learning Journey – 15 Days  
*A clean, structured and humantic SQL learning roadmap by Pranab.*

Welcome to my SQL Learning Repository.  
I created this 15-day SQL journey to build a strong foundation in databases, queries, joins, procedures, functions, triggers, window functions and so much more.

Everything inside this repo is written by me step-by-step using a custom database named **`pranab_learning`**, along with completely original tables, examples, and scripts — no copied data, no company references.

This project is a genuine reflection of my learning, consistency and commitment toward becoming a better Data Analyst.

##  What’s Inside?

Each day has its own SQL script focusing on a specific topic.  
You can open any `.sql` file and run it directly in MySQL Workbench / XAMPP / Local Server.

### ** Daily Breakdown**
| Day | Topic |
|-----|-------|
| Day 01 | Basics: CREATE, INSERT, SELECT |
| Day 02 | Filtering: WHERE, AND, OR, BETWEEN, IN |
| Day 03 | ORDER BY & LIMIT |
| Day 04 | DISTINCT, COUNT, LIKE, Wildcards |
| Day 05 | SQL Functions & CASE |
| Day 06 | GROUP BY & HAVING |
| Day 07 | Constraints (PK, FK, UNIQUE, CHECK) |
| Day 08 | Foreign Keys + CASCADE |
| Day 09 | JOINS – Inner, Left, Right, Full, Self |
| Day 10 | Business Queries (Sales, Totals) |
| Day 11 | Subqueries (Basic → Advanced) |
| Day 12 | Window Functions (Rank, Row_Number, Ntile…) |
| Day 13 | User-Defined Functions |
| Day 14 | Stored Procedures & Cursors |
| Day 15 | Views, Indexes, Triggers & Audits |

##  Why I Made This

I wanted a place where I could:

- Practise SQL consistently  
- Track my progress day-by-day  
- Build a clean public portfolio  
- Share my learnings with others  
- Stay disciplined and honest with my process  

Every single file in this repo was written with care, clarity and honesty.

## ❤️ Personal Note

I come from a place where learning, growth and discipline matter a lot to me.  
This 15-day SQL journey is not just a project — it’s a reminder that I can build myself, one step at a time.

If you're standing somewhere between confusion and clarity, consistency will take you forward.  
Just start… even if it’s slow.

Thanks for checking out my SQL repo.  
Keep learning, keep growing.
